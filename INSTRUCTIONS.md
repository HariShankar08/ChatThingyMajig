## Instructions - pls read
if you dont i'll have an existential crisis that's why.

While doing the posts part, pls edit the "posts.py" file.

This makes it possible for the same app to be spread across multiple files. 

Which is good. Like, really.

And for templates, please upload/ create files into the design/ folder.

Also, please look through the old template files, and please maintain the same `<div>` ids or `<form>` method and action parameters. Because otherwise it will be a pain making it work with the backend AKA flask.
